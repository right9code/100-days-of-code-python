# Day 1 - Beginner - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data
## Concepts Practised :
- [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task1.py)Printing to the Console in Python
- String Manipulation and Code Intelligence
    - [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task2.py)Print modifier: also to avoid "double quotes" to be identified as command use 'single quotes' to differentiate.
    - [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task2.py)Also we can use "\" backslash to tell the interpreter to ignore the "double quotes or 'single quotes' as command.
    - [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task3.py)Adding a line break or adding new line with "\n".
    - [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task3.py)String Concatenation: Combining Strings with "+".
    - [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task3.py)3 methods of adding space between strings.
- [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task4.py)Debugging
    - [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task3.py)Basic Errors like "syntax error', ' indentation error'.
- [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task5.py)The Python Input Function
- [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task6.py)Python Variables
    - [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task7.py) len = character count(length) variable
    - [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task8.py)Switching Variables with the help of third variable.
- Variable Naming
    - [ðŸ”— ](https://github.com/right9code/100-days-of-code-python/blob/main/day1/task9.py)Naming Variable.
        - Can't use space in names of variable "user name" it should one single word you can use "_" though "user_name".
        - You can't start the name of a variable with a no. "1abhi" you can end with it though "abhi1".
        - Don't use name of functions like "print","input" etc. as variable to avoid confusion and as a better practice.
        - Python shows variable typo as NameError.
