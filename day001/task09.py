# Naming Variable
# Can't use space in names of variable "user name" it should one single word you can use "_" though "user_name"
# You can't start the name of a variable with a no. "1abhi" you can end with it though "abhi1"
# Don't use functions name like "print","input" etc. as variable to avoid confusion and as a better practice.
# Python shows variable typo as NameError.

#QUIZ:

# 1.Which line of Python code is valid?
# a = 12 (var a = 12, a: 12, 12 = a)

# 2.Which is the best variable name for Player 1's username?
# player1_username = "jackbauer" (p1 user name = "jackbauer", 1_player_username = "jackbauer", p1u = "jackbauer")

#Which block of code will produce an error? For extra points, which type of error do you think it will produce?

# time_until_midnight = "5"
# print("There are " + time_until_Midnight + " hours until midnight")
# (M is capital in 2nd line but not in first as variable)

# num_hours = "5"
# print("There are " + num_hours + " hours until midnight")

# time_until_midnight = "5"
# print("There are "+time_until_midnight+" hours until midnight")
